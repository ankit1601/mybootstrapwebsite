							It takes a special kind of zeal to follow your vision, but it takes even more courage to close down a successful business to pursue a bigger dream.
							This journey begins in 1983 when Dilip Chhabria returned to India after spending a year at General Motor’s Design Center in Detroit. Having studied Transportation Design from the prestigious Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, his experience in the car mass-production business soon made him realize that his passion lay in developing and designing unique creations. He took the entrepreneurial plunge and started creating automotive accessories for the mass market and he got succeeded beacuse he was passionate.

							It is said that if you love what you do for a living then you will never see it as ‘just a job’. By that maxim Dilip Chhabria has possibly never ever worked a day in his life. For him the business of car design and modification is an amalgamation of his passion, hobby and work.
							In DC we see the marriage of an artist’s sensibilities and an engineer’s mind. He infuses each of his projects with an aesthetic awareness while simultaneously pushing the machine’s capabilities to a new level. Every DC creation is a signature extension of the artist’s personality and while never two of his products are the same, they are instantly recognizable as having made by the same master.

							Car tuning is modification of the performance or appearance of a vehicle. Most vehicles leave the factory set up for an average driver's expectations and normal conditions. Tuning, on the other hand, has become a way to personalize the characteristics of a vehicle to the owner's preference. Cars may be altered to provide better fuel economy, produce more power, or to provide better handling.

										<p class="textAlign">DC Design was founded in 1993 with the dual aim of redesigning and modifying mass market cars to create one-of-a-kind automotive beauties for automotive connoisseurs as well as offering design and prototyping services to the OEM automotive sector.
										And a legend was born. DCD has produced more than 600 unique design cars; from supercars to a complete re-haul of the humble Ambassador. DCD has also provided design and prototyping services to the likes of Aston Martin, Renault and GM. Today DCD also designs and refurbishes aircraft interiors. DCD is now synonymous with bespoke luxury and avant-garde automotive design.Many cars were "hopped up" with engine modifications such as adding additional carburetors, high compression heads and dual exhausts. Engine swaps were done, the object of which was to put the most powerful engine in the lightest possible frame and body combination.With the change in automobile design to encase the wheels in fenders and to extend the hood to the full width of the car, the former practices were no longer possible. In addition, there was tremendous automotive advertising and subsequent public interest in the new models in the 1950s. Hence custom cars came into existence, swapping headlamp rings, grilles, bumpers, chrome side strips, and tail lights, as well as frenching and tunnelling head- and taillights. The bodies of the cars were changed by cutting through the sheet metal, removing bits to make the car lower, welding it back together, and adding a lot of lead to make the resulting form smooth (hence the term lead sled; </p>
